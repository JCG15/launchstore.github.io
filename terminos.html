			These are the terms and conditions (“T&Cs”) of Focusrite Audio Engineering Limited (the “Company”), a company incorporated and registered in England and Wales with registered number 02357989 whose registered offices are at Windsor House, Turnpike Road, High Wycombe HP12 3FX and whose VAT number is GB 218 9881 62, which shall apply to any Contract entered into between the Company and a Buyer.<br><br>

			The Buyer's attention is in particular drawn to the limitations and exclusions of liability contained in conditions 4.5 (Company’s liability for delays), 5.2 and 5.3 (Company’s liability for non-delivery), 9.6 (Company’s warranty liability), 10.3 (Company’s Contract liability) and 12 (Force Majeure).<br><br>

			 

			<h3>INTERPRETATION</h3><br><br>

			Force Majeure Event: has the meaning given to it in condition 12.
			Goods: any goods agreed in the Contract to be supplied to the Buyer by the Company (including any part or parts of them).<br><br>
			 

			1.2  A reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as it is in force for the time being taking account of any amendment, extension, application or re-enactment and includes any subordinate legislation for the time being in force made under it.<br><br>

			1.3  Headings do not affect the interpretation of these T&Cs.<br><br>

			1.4  Any words following the terms “including”, “include”, or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms.<br><br>

			 

			<h3>2. APPLICATION OF TERMS</h3><br><br>

			2.1  The Contract shall be concluded solely on the terms set out in these T&Cs to the exclusion of all other terms and conditions (including any terms or conditions which the Buyer purports to apply under any purchase order, confirmation of order, specification or other document).<br><br>

			2.2  No terms or conditions endorsed on, delivered with or contained in the Buyer's purchase order, confirmation of order, specification or other document shall form part of the Contract (including where such terms or conditions are referred to in any document forming part of the Contract) and the Buyer hereby waives any rights and remedies it may have under any such terms or conditions.<br><br>

			2.3  These T&Cs apply to all the Company's sales and any variation to these T&Cs and any representations about the Goods shall have no effect unless expressly agreed in writing and signed by Mr Phil Dudderidge of the Company.<br><br>

			2.4  The Contract formed on these T&Cs constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. The Buyer acknowledges that it has not relied on any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of the Company which is not set out in the Contract. Nothing in this condition 2.4 shall exclude or limit the Company's liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.<br><br>

			2.5  Each order or acceptance of a quotation for Goods by the Buyer from the Company shall be deemed to be an offer by the Buyer to purchase Goods subject to these T&Cs.<br><br>

			2.6  No order placed by the Buyer shall be deemed to be accepted by the Company until a written acknowledgement of order is issued by the Company or (if earlier) the Company delivers the Goods to the Buyer.<br><br>

			2.7  The Buyer shall ensure that the terms of its order and any applicable specification are complete and accurate.<br><br>

			2.8  Any quotation is given on the basis that no Contract shall come into existence until the Company despatches an acknowledgement of order to the Buyer. Any quotation is valid for a period of 30 days only from its date, provided that the Company has not previously withdrawn it.<br><br>
